# LEDBeerPong (2020)

This repository stores the electrical code and the assembly ideas of the built of my LED beerpong table I created in the summer of 2020.

The main idea was to create a resilient and appealing beerpong table that is able to count the current number of cups on each side of the table and transfer this information into visual feedback.

## Controls:

<div align="center">

  </p>
</div>

The electrics are controled by two [Arduino Mega](https://www.reichelt.de/de/de/arduino-mega-2560-atmega-2560-usb-arduino-mega-p119696.html) (one for each side) which restricts the code creation in C++. \
Since I was basically new to coding with this programming language, I created multiple ideas for the control that can be found in the source folder. \
Please also note that most of the code is created by a beginner. Thus, finding ways to optimize this code shouldn't be hard...

## Built:

## Explanations and details:

If you are interested in details of the table and the decision making, I recommend to read the [explanation and details document](docs/README.md). Here you will find some explanations of why I chose certain electronical elements and more insights to the financial aspect.

## Contributions:

I stopped the creation of my code in the beginning of 2021. Further, this table is not in use anymore. \
Hence, I most likely will not change anything anymore.

However, feel free to fork this repository yourself or contact me regarding questions. \
Moreover, if you are interested in buying this table you can contact me as well.
