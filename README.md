# LEDBeerPong (2020)

This repository stores the electrical code and the assembly ideas of the built of my LED beerpong table I created in the summer of 2020.

The main idea was to create a resilient and appealing beerpong table that is able to count the current number of cups on each side of the table and transfer this information into visual feedback.

## Electrics:

The electrics are controled by two Arduino Mega (one for each side) which restricts the code creation in C++. \
During the time I created multiple ideas for the control that can be found in the source folder.
